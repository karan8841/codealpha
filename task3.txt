Developing a **Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using tools like **Snort** or **Suricata** is a practical approach for monitoring network traffic and identifying potential security breaches. These tools are open-source network intrusion detection systems that can detect a wide range of attacks based on predefined or custom rules.

### Objectives of the NIDS Project:
1. **Set up Snort or Suricata for traffic monitoring.**
2. **Define detection rules to identify suspicious or malicious activities.**
3. **Configure alerts to notify the system or administrators about suspicious activity.**
4. **Visualize the detected attacks using a dashboard or logs.**

In this guide, we'll focus on setting up **Snort**, but the process for **Suricata** is quite similar.

### 1. **Setting Up Snort on a Linux Server**

#### **Step 1: Install Snort**

You can install Snort on a Linux-based server (e.g., Ubuntu). Here’s how to install Snort on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y snort
```

During the installation, you'll be prompted to configure the **network interface** for Snort to monitor. Choose the interface you want Snort to analyze (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).

#### **Step 2: Configure Snort**

Once Snort is installed, you need to configure it by editing its configuration files:

- **snort.conf**: The main configuration file where Snort’s behavior is defined.

The file is typically located in `/etc/snort/`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

Here, you’ll need to adjust the following settings:
- **Network Interface**: Set the interface you want to monitor.
  
  Find the line:
  ```bash
  ipvar HOME_NET [your_network_range]
  ```
  For example:
  ```bash
  ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
  ```
  This defines your local network range.

- **Snort Rules**: Snort uses rules to detect suspicious activity. The default rule set is located in `/etc/snort/rules/`. These rules are regularly updated by the Snort community.

  You can download the latest set of community rules by visiting the Snort website and following their instructions to download rules.

#### **Step 3: Define Custom Rules**

Custom rules are added to Snort’s configuration to detect specific suspicious patterns or attacks.

You can add custom rules in the `local.rules` file located in `/etc/snort/rules/`.

Here is an example of a custom rule to detect ICMP ping floods (a simple DDoS attack):

```bash
alert icmp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP Ping Flood"; dsize:>1000; sid:1000001;)
```

This rule triggers an alert when there is a large ICMP packet (e.g., more than 1000 bytes) from an external network to your internal network.

#### **Step 4: Test Snort Configuration**

To test your Snort configuration, run the following command:

```bash
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

This will check the configuration and ensure that everything is set up correctly.

#### **Step 5: Running Snort**

Once everything is set up, you can start Snort to monitor traffic:

```bash
sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```

This command tells Snort to run with alert messages printed to the console (`-A console`), using the specified configuration file, and monitoring the `eth0` network interface.

### 2. **Setting Up Alerts**

Snort can generate alerts based on the rules you set. These alerts can be sent to various destinations, including:
- Console output (as shown above)
- Log files
- Syslog server
- Email notifications (through integration with other tools like **Swatchdog**)

Alerts can be written to a log file (typically in `/var/log/snort/alert`), where each log entry represents a detected event. Here's an example of an alert message in the log:

```
[**] [1:1000001:0] ICMP Ping Flood [**]
[Priority: 3] 
12/11-13:05:30.123456 192.168.1.10 -> 192.168.1.1
ICMP TTL:64 TOS:0x0 ID:512 IpLen:20 DgmLen:1024
Type:8  Code:0  ID:4567  Seq:1
```

### 3. **Visualizing Detected Attacks**

To visualize the detected attacks, you can use tools like **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **SIEM solutions** (Security Information and Event Management).

#### **Step 1: Install the ELK Stack**

1. **Install Elasticsearch**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
   ```

2. **Install Logstash** (to ingest Snort logs):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install logstash
   ```

3. **Install Kibana** (for visualizations):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install kibana
   ```

#### **Step 2: Configure Logstash to Parse Snort Logs**

Logstash needs to parse Snort logs and send them to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis.

Create a configuration file for Logstash (e.g., `/etc/logstash/conf.d/snort_logstash.conf`):

```bash
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/snort/alert"
    start_position => "beginning"
  }
}

filter {
  # Parse Snort log format (you can use Grok filters here)
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{SNORT_ALERT}" }
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "snort-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
```

#### **Step 3: Configure Kibana Dashboards**

Once the logs are sent to Elasticsearch, you can use Kibana to create dashboards to visualize attack data, such as the number of alerts over time, the types of attacks detected, and the sources of attacks.

- Open Kibana in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5601`).
- Create visualizations for the incoming Snort logs.
- Build dashboards to monitor security events in real-time.

You can use **Kibana's prebuilt visualizations** or customize them as per your requirements.

### 4. **Testing the System**

To test your NIDS system, simulate traffic such as:
- **Port scanning** (using `nmap`).
- **ICMP floods** (using `ping` or `hping3`).
- **SQL Injection** or **DDoS** attacks (via web requests).

Snort will generate alerts for these attacks based on your rule set.

### Example Test Command:**

Simulate an ICMP flood with `hping3`:

```bash
hping3 -i u1000 --flood 192.168.1.1
```

This will flood the target IP address with ICMP requests, which should trigger the "ICMP Ping Flood" rule you defined earlier.

### 5. **Responding to Alerts**

You can integrate Snort with other tools for automatic responses. For instance, Snort can run in combination with a firewall to block IP addresses identified as malicious or respond with custom scripts to contain attacks.

You can configure **Snort's output** to trigger custom scripts, which can automatically adjust firewall rules or send notifications.

For example, you could write a script that blocks IP addresses identified as part of a DDoS attack:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Block suspicious IP based on Snort alert
iptables -A INPUT -s $1 -j DROP
```

### Summary of Steps:

1. **Install and Configure Snort**:
   - Set up Snort to monitor network traffic.
   - Define rules for detecting common network attacks.
   
2. **Set Up Alerting**:
   - Configure Snort to generate alerts on suspicious activities.
   
3. **Visualize Attacks**:
   - Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log storage and visualization.
   
4. **Testing**:
   - Simulate attacks (e.g., ping floods, port scans) and confirm alerts are triggered.

5. **Automated Responses**:
   - Integrate with firewall rules to block malicious traffic or trigger other responses.

This process gives you a comprehensive, scalable solution for monitoring and responding to network-based intrusions, using open-source tools like **Snort**, **ELK Stack**, and custom scripts for automated responses.
